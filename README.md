# MB:P 1.5 Pool Generator

This app helps you create pools to manage mutliple tables with the same game of Mythic Battles: Pantheon.

## Why a new app

I wasn't pleased with the few apps I found around the web. Some of them pushes you to make the full draft in the app, most of them aren't updated for v1.5, and none of those I found made sure you could use multiple pools with the same game (basically just making sure each character is not used in multiple pools).

## How to use it

Just launch the index.html with your browser, or go to http://www.malexandre.fr/mbp15. The app is in French, but is pretty basic: select your boxes, select the number of parallel tables you want, select how many units of each type you want (in order: Gods, Heroes, Monsters, Troops), and if you want check the two last boxes to add Titans and/or Veterans.
